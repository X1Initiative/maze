maze.py contains two different algorithms to simplify binary
2D array representing a black and white image. There are two 
methods, one invoked by calling the function "condense" and 
the other invoked by calling the function "condense_with_ones."
condense_with_ones is the better algorithm, condense only works
under ideal conditions.
