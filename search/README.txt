Functions to perform BFS on a maze represented by a 2D array

bfs function gathers a solution and outputs list of nodes it visited
in order. convert_bfs_to_data takes in the maze and the solution provided
by bfs and converts that solution to a data format that the on board team wants.
convert_bfs_to_data writes solution to a data directory, so be sure you have one
before running. All files are of the format data_[timestamp].txt, and all files
of this format will be ignored with git because of the .gitignore.
